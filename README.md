# Hohmann-Transfer-LEO-to-GEO-

Purpose: This module was made to calculate the the fuel consumption and delta v values of a spacecraft transferring orbits. Moreover, I took the parameters of the SpaceX Starship to calculate the fuel consupmtion needed for the most efficient maneuver possible to save on cost. Due to the large size of Starship and its vast transport capabilities this orbital transfer maneuver could be feasible to release satallites in various orbits within one mission.

This module is setup in the following way for each code box:
- 1. Hohmann transfer with statc mass
- 2. Non-static mass, with required input
- 3. Starship orbit transfer (no plot)
- 4. Starship orbit transfer (with plot)
- 5.  Starship orbit transfer (with plot of full ellipse)
